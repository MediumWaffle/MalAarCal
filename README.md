# MalAarCal - Trig Trot

Our project is to make an infinite size scrolling platformer.  
This is a type of game where the main character, is on a 2D plane.  
And they walk around on a solid block and dodge objects in 2D space.  
Think of Mario bros.  
Our game will be replicating the infitite generating aspect of flappy bird and the similar game mechanics of geometry dash.
